<p>In most cases, a farmer is very poor. Most farmers do not have their own land. So, he cultivates the land of others. He survives only by meeting his basic needs. He works hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. The crops planted by the farmers, grow and by cutting those crops we get our necessary food. They work hard in the crop field, reaping bumper crops. Which helps in the development of our national economy.
