    <P>People often wonder where the term
        cascading
        comes from. The cascade is an
        application
        hierarchy
        , which is a fancy
        term for a system of how rules are applied. If you examine
        the
        <strong>five types</strong>
        of style sheets just introduced, you'll notice that there are numerous means
        of applying style to the same document
